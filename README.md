Code for some projects in the book Python Playground (Mahesh Venkitachalam):

1. Parsing Itunes Lists.
The goals in this project are to find duplicates in your music collection,
identify tracks shared between playlists, plot the distribution of track durations 
and graph the relationship between song ratings and length.

2. Spirographs.
The goal in this project is creating an animation of Spirographlike drawing curves.
The completed drawings must be saved as PNG image files. 

3. Conway's game of life

4. Generating musical overtones with the Karpus-Strong Algorithm

5. Using Reynolds's three rules to create a Boids simulation of the flocking behavior 
of n birds and plot their positions and directions of movement over time.

6. ASCII art. Using Python to create a program that generates ASCII art from graphical images

7. Photomosaics. Create mosaics using Python.

8. Autostereograms. Create an autostereogram from an input depth map image.
