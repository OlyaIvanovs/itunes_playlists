# python_playground
Code for some projects in the book Python Playground (Mahesh Venkitachalam):

1. Parsing Itunes Lists.
The goals in this project are to find duplicates in your music collection,
identify tracks shared between playlists, plot the distribution of track durations 
and graph the relationship between song ratings and length.

2. Spirographs.
The goal in this project is creating an animation of Spirographlike drawing curves.
The completed drawings must be saved as PNG image files.
